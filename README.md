#Jiahang Luo's Project

Welcome to my repository! Below is a brief introduction about me and a reflection on my GitHub workflow experience for this assignment.

About Me

Hello! My name is Jiahang Luo, and I have a deep interest in managing long-term relationships and conducting academic research in this area. I am currently working on developing my technical skills and applying them to various projects. I also enjoy reading books like Pressured Economy, which offers insights into the modern economy.

Workflow Reflection

For this assignment, I used Git and GitHub to manage my files and version control. The steps I followed were:

Initialized the repository locally using git init.
Created a new branch for my work to avoid any changes to the main branch.
Added my files and committed changes frequently with git add and git commit.
Pushed my changes to my GitHub repository using git push.
